### Basic exercise: Render a Book List
See books.json for all exercises. Feel free to add books on your own.

1. **Fetch** a JSON file containing a list of books, where each book has properties like `title`, `author`, `yearPublished`, `genre`, `rating` (1-5 stars), and `coverImageURL`.
2. **Render** the books in a card layout, displaying the `title`, `author`, `yearPublished`, and `genre`. Show the `coverImageURL` as a thumbnail if provided.


### Advanced exercises
   - Display books by rating in descending order.
   - Add a dropdown filter to display books by `genre`.
   - Allow sorting by `yearPublished` (e.g., "Oldest to Newest" or "Newest to Oldest").
   - Add a search box to filter books by title.
